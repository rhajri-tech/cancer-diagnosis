# cancer-diagnosis
This Project is done using K-Nearest Classifier on (Cancer Diagnosis Dataset)
________________________________________________________________


** ABOUT DATASET **

- The dataset contains over 500 rows of cancer patients with important features showing if patient is diagonised with cancer or not like its shape, area, raduis, texture and alot more.


** ABOUT MODEL **

- Above problem is solved using KNN model machine learning techniques and the model is trained and tested on seperate set of datasets and reached over 90% of accuracy. 

- The model can predict wether the patient is diagnosed to cancer or not by providing 5 required features as ["radius_mean", "radius_mean", "area_mean", "area_worst", "symmetry_mean"].

- Make sure you have installed required libraries in order to be able to run the program. (Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas)
